The tract here reprinted formed part of
a remarkable volume which came to the
Cambridge University Library in 1715 by the ,
gift of King George the First. with the rest of
the collection formed by John Moote. Bishop
of Ely. The first of the eleven separate pieces
contained in the volume was the Vulgaria
Terentii printed at Antwerp by G. Leeu in
1486: another was the Epistulae Karon printed
at Paris by P. Levet in 1485: the last was the
Augustinus Datus. No other copy of any of
these three is known to exist.
